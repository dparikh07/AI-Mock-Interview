Getting Started
To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

bash
Copy code
`npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev`

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

You can start making changes by editing app/page.js. The changes will automatically reflect in your browser thanks to the hot-reloading feature.

This project utilizes the next/font feature to optimize and load Google Fonts, including the custom "Inter" font for a better user experience.
